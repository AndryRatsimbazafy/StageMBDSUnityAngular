# Salon Angular without assets folder   
## Important:   
   ## `Don't push assets folder`
## Directive
  This project doesn't run (it wasn't create for that) cause assets folder is missing !   
  You need the angular project with assets in another folder and copy paste the content in this project (without .git folder) to that folder and run from there for testing !
